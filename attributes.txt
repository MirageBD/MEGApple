GOTOX CLEARED ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Screen RAM byte 0
			Bits 7 - 0		Lower 8 bits of character number, the same as the VIC-II and VIC-III

	Screen RAM byte 1
			Bits 7 – 5		Trim pixels from right-hand side of character (bits 0 – 2)
			Bits 4 - 0		Upper 5 bits of character number (bits 8 – 12), allowing addressing of 8,192 unique characters

	Colour RAM byte 0
			Bit 7			Vertically flip the character
			Bit 6			Horizontally flip the character
			Bit 5			Alpha blend mode (leave 0, discussed later)
			Bit 4			GOTOX is cleared (set to 0) GOTOX allows repositioning of characters along a raster via the Raster-Rewrite Buffer.
							Must be set to 0 for displaying characters
			Bit 3			If set, Full-Colour characters use 4 bits per pixel and are 16 pixels wide (less any right-hand side trim bits),
							instead of using 8 bits per	pixel. When using 8 bits per pixels, the characters are the normal 8 pixels wide
			Bit 2			Trim pixels from right-hand side of character (bit 3)
			Bits 1 – 0		Number of pixels to trim from top or bottom of character

	Colour RAM byte 1
		VIC-II multi-colour mode enabled:
			Bits 7 – 4		Upper 4 bits of colour of character
			Bits 3 – 0		Low 4 bits of colour of character
		VIC-III extended attributes enabled:
			Bit 7			Hardware underlining of character
			Bit 6			Hardware bold attribute of character *
			Bit 5			Hardware reverse video enable of character *
			Bit 4			Hardware blink of character
			Bits 3 – 0		Low 4 bits of colour of character

GOTOX SET: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Screen RAM byte 0
			Bits 7 - 0		Lower 8 bits of new X position to start drawing the next character, relative to the start of character drawing.
							Setting to 0 causes the next character to be drawn over the top of the left-most character.
	Screen RAM byte 1
			Bits 7 - 5		FCM Character data Y offset: Characters display normally when set to zero. When non-zero, 8 × the value is added to the
							character address. With careful planning, this can be used to smoothly vertically scroll multiple layers of RRB content.
			Bits 4 - 3		RESERVED, set to 0
			Bits 1 - 0		Upper 2 bits of new X position

	Colour RAM byte 0
			Bit 7			If set, then background/transparent pixels will not be drawn for subsequent characters, allowing layering
			Bit 6			If set, the following characters will be rendered as background, allowing sprites to appear in front of them, even when sprites are set to background.
			Bit 5			RESERVED, set to 0
			Bit 4			GOTOX, set to 1. GOTOX allows repositioning of characters along a raster via the Raster-Rewrite Buffer.
							Must be set to 0 for displaying characters
			Bit 3			ROWMASK. If set, then the pixel row mask is used to determine which pixel rows of the following characters should be rendered.
							This can be used to vertically scroll characters using the Raster-Rewrite Buffer, by drawing each character twice, once
							shifted down on the screen line on which it appears, and a second time, shifted up in the following screen line, and masked so that
							only the pixel rows belonging to the scrolled character are displayed, and not data from either before or after that character’s data.
			Bit 2			If set, the following characters will be rendered as foreground, regardless of their colouring, allowing sprites to appear behind them.
			Bits 1 - 0		RESERVED, set to 0

	Colour RAM byte 1
			Bits 7 - 0		Pixel row mask flags
